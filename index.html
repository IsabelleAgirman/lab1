            <h3>Intro</h3>
            <p>
              I am born and raised in Västerås, Sweden. I have lots of great
              memories from my childhood but one of my favorite memories is
              sitting next to my older brother at the computer while we played
              and solved various escape games together.

            <p>
              I have always had an interest in IT. Even during high school,
              classmates came to me when they needed help with their computers.
              This then led to me being named "The Class IT Girl" when we
              graduated. That's why it felt natural to study Computer Science at
              university. I like working with both frontend and backend,
              preferably within web.

            <p>
              A future goal that I have is to work as a web developer. I want to

              leave the user satisfied.
